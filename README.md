## Description

This is a demo for cryptocurrency application use [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) api. The problem is the api can't be used in the client side through cors configuration. as written in the documentation.

```
Note: Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently prohibited through CORS
configuration. This is to protect your API Key which should not be visible to users of your 
application so your API Key is not stolen. Secure your API Key by routing calls through your
own backend service.
```

So i make a backend application that solve the problem. In case this application to work please run this [crypto-backend](https://github.com/celest1al/crypto-backend) first.
